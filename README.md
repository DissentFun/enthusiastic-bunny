This project is a microservice implementation of the REST component of the Discord API.

It implements an aspect of an architecture similar to that [described in DasWolke's whitepaper](https://gist.github.com/DasWolke/c9d7dfe6a78445011162a12abd32091d) on chatbots using a microservice architecture.

The documentation for this project will be expanded further, however for now it may be helpful to refer the [the whitepaper](https://gist.github.com/DasWolke/c9d7dfe6a78445011162a12abd32091d) linked above.
